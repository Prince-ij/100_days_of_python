# 100 Days of Python - My Professional Development Journey
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python repository! 🚀 This is where I embark on a structured, project-driven journey to master Python, progressing from a beginner to a professional-level developer. Each day, I tackle a new project, reinforcing my understanding of core programming concepts, libraries, and real-world applications.

## **Project Categories**  

Throughout this journey, I have worked on projects across diverse domains, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts and real-world applications:  

- **Automation & Scripting** – Writing efficient scripts to automate repetitive tasks and optimize workflows.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development** – Building interactive and user-friendly desktop applications.  
- **Game Development** – Developing engaging games using Python’s **Turtle** module and other libraries.  
- **Web Scraping & Data Extraction** – Collecting and processing web data using **BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and APIs**.  
- **Frontend Web Development** – Creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
- **Backend Web Development** – Designing and deploying dynamic web applications using **Flask**.  
- **Data Science & Machine Learning** – Analyzing data, visualizing trends, and building predictive models with **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn**.  


# 🏆 The Final 20 Days – My Path to Professionalism
The last 20 days of this journey are dedicated to self-driven projects across multiple domains, where I apply everything I’ve learned to create meaningful and complex applications. These projects serve as a testament to my growth, creativity, and problem-solving skills, solidifying my path to becoming a professional Python developer.
